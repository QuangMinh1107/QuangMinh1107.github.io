            <h1>Profile</h1>
            <p>My experience in PR and celebrity recruitment puts me in an excellent position for the role of Relations
                Officer. My previous positions have required me to manage celebrity projects with multi-media components
                including broadcast, print, film, photographic and digital (social media). I have handled celebrity
                related communications plans and outputs, project managed celebrity events, worked with celebrity
                agents, publicist and managers and hosted VIPs on field missions. I speak several languages and have
                travelled extensively, making me an excellent candidate for the international position I am seeking.</p>
