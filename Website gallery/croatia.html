                <h2>The Plitvice Lakes National Park</h2>
                <p>Croatia’s most popular tourist attraction, was granted UNESCO World Heritage status in 1979. Located
                    roughly halfway between capital city Zagreb and Zadar on the coast, the lakes are a definite
                    must-see in Croatia. (As confirmed by the many emails we’ve received!)
                    The beauty of the National Park lies in its sixteen lakes, inter-connected by a series of
                    waterfalls, and set in deep woodland populated by deer, bears, wolves, boars and rare bird species.
                    The National Park covers a total area of 300 square kilometres, whilst the lakes join together over
                    a distance of eight kilometres.</p>
