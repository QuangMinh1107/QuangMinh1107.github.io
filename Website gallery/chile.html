                <h2>Torres del Paine National Park</h2>
                <p>Torres del Paine National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Torres del Paine)[3] is a national park
                    encompassing mountains, glaciers, lakes, and rivers in southern Chilean Patagonia. The Cordillera
                    del Paine is the centerpiece of the park. It lies in a transition area between the Magellanic
                    subpolar forests and the Patagonian Steppes. The park is located 112 km (70 mi) north of Puerto
                    Natales and 312 km (194 mi) north of Punta Arenas. The park borders Bernardo O'Higgins National Park
                    to the west and the Los Glaciares National Park to the north in Argentine territory. Paine means
                    "blue" in the native Tehuelche (Aonikenk) language and is pronounced PIE-nay, while Torres means
                    "towers".[4]

                    Torres del Paine National Park is part of the Sistema Nacional de Áreas Silvestres Protegidas del
                    Estado de Chile (National System of Protected Forested Areas of Chile). In 2013, it measured
                    approximately 181,414 hectares.[1] It is one of the largest and most visited parks in Chile. The
                    park averages around 252,000 visitors a year, of which 54% are foreign tourists,[2] who come from
                    many countries all over the world. It is also part of the End of the World Route, a tourist scenic
                    route.

                    The park is one of the 11 protected areas of the Magallanes Region and Chilean Antarctica (together
                    with four national parks, three national reserves, and three national monuments). Together, the
                    protected forested areas comprise about 51% of the land of the region (6,728,744 hectares).

                    The Torres del Paine are the distinctive three granite peaks of the Paine mountain range or Paine
                    Massif. From left to right they are known as Torres d'Agostini, Torres Central and Torres Monzino.
                    They extend up to 2,500 metres (8,200 ft) above sea level, and are joined by the Cuernos del Paine.
                    The area also boasts valleys, rivers such as the Paine, lakes, and glaciers. The well-known lakes
                    include Grey, Pehoé, Nordenskiöld, and Sarmiento. The glaciers, including Grey, Pingo and Tyndall,
                    belong to the Southern Patagonia Ice Field.</p>

                    <h3>HIKE THE FRENCH VALLEY</h3>
                    <p>The French Valley is considered one of the most beautiful hikes in the world. This trail is
                        between the 10,000ft Paine Grande and the spectacular Torres del Paine and Los Cuernos
                        mountains, with hanging glaciers above the trail. Throughout this full day’s hike enjoy
                        fantastic views of the natural granite amphitheater that makes up this enclosed valley, as well
                        as the waterscapes below including lakes Pehoe, Skottsberg, Toro and Nordenskjold. It is also
                        possible to hear and see avalanches coming down from the glacier. Hike deep and high into the
                        valley or relax and soak in the scenery before trekking onward to Paine Grande Lodge where you
                        can enjoy a pisco sour (famed South American cocktail) as the sun sets over the Paine Grande and
                        Los Cuernos Mountains. See this hike and other activities in Torres del Paine National Park in a
                        few of our Chile Trip Ideas.

                    <h3>RIDE HORSEBACK THROUGH TORRES DEL PAINE NATIONAL PARK</h3>
                    <p>A horseback ride in Torres del Paine can be one of the most enjoyable ways to see the park. It is
                        a great way to cover a lot more territory and can also save your leg strength between hiking
                        days. Home to many large estancias (ranches) and still vibrant with the culture of the gaucho
                        (traditional horsemen), it is a rider’s paradise. Rides vary in difficulty depending on your
                        riding experience and can be a great addition to your Patagonia adventure trip. For the real
                        riding enthusiast check out our Estancias Of Patagonia By Horseback Trip.
