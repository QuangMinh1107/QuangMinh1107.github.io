                <h2>Salar de Uyuni</h2>
                <p>Salar de Uyuni (or Salar de Tunupa)[1] is the world's largest salt flat, or playa, at over 10,000
                    square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) in area.[2] It is in the Daniel Campos Province in Potosí in
                    southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes at an elevation of 3,656 meters (11,995 ft) above sea
                    level.[3]

                    The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between several prehistoric lakes. It is covered
                    by a few meters of salt crust, which has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation
                    variations within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The crust serves as a source of salt
                    and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in lithium. It contains 50% to 70% of the
                    world's known lithium reserves according to a 2009 Foreign Policy article by Joshua Keating.[4] The
                    large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the surface make the Salar ideal for
                    calibrating the altimeters of Earth observation satellites.[5][6][7][8][9] Following rain, a thin
                    layer of dead calm water transforms the flat into the world's largest mirror, 129 kilometres (80
                    miles) across.[10]

                    The Salar serves as the major transport route across the Bolivian Altiplano and is a prime breeding
                    ground for several species of flamingos. Salar de Uyuni is also a climatological transitional zone
                    since the towering tropical cumulus congestus and cumulonimbus incus clouds that form in the eastern
                    part of the salt flat during the summer cannot permeate beyond its drier western edges, near the
                    Chilean border and the Atacama Desert.</p>

                    <h3>What’s the best way to see it?</h3>
                    <p>One of the best ways to truly experience the Salar is on a guided 4WD tour with six or seven
                        other people. While it’s possible to do day tours across the salt flats, most trips run for
                        three or four days and head deeper into the Altiplano. The price should include a driver, guide
                        and cook (often combined into one very talented human), food, transport and basic
                        dormitory-style accommodation. Avoid tours that spend a night in a ‘salt hotel’ (yep, hotels
                        made of salt), as these run off the water grid and pollute the local environment

                    <h3>When to go?</h3>
                    <p>The flats are accessible year-round. From May to November, the weather is mild and clear, but the
                        salt pans are baked dry, so there’s no mirror effect. From January to April, during the summer
                        wet, the flats are sheeted in water; while mostly drivable, access to Isla Wasi can be
                        impossible
