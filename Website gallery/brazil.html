                <h2>Iguazu Falls</h2>
                <p>Iguazú Falls or Iguaçu Falls (Spanish: Cataratas del Iguazú [kataˈɾatas ðel iɣwaˈsu]; Guarani:
                    Chororo Yguasu [ɕoɾoɾo ɨɣʷasu]; Portuguese: Cataratas do Iguaçu [kataˈɾatɐs du iɡwaˈsu]) are
                    waterfalls of the Iguazu River on the border of the Argentine province of Misiones and the Brazilian
                    state of Paraná. Together, they make up the largest waterfall in the world.[2] The falls divide the
                    river into the upper and lower Iguazu. The Iguazu River rises near the heart of the city of
                    Curitiba. For most of its course, the river flows through Brazil; however, most of the falls are on
                    the Argentine side. Below its confluence with the San Antonio River, the Iguazu River forms the
                    border between Argentina and Brazil.

                    The name "Iguazú" comes from the Guarani or Tupi words "y" [ɨ], meaning "water", and "ûasú "[waˈsu],
                    meaning "big".[3] Legend has it that a deity planned to marry a beautiful woman named Naipí, who
                    fled with her mortal lover Tarobá in a canoe. In a rage, the deity sliced the river, creating the
                    waterfalls and condemning the lovers to an eternal fall.[3] The first European to record the
                    existence of the falls was the Spanish Conquistador Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1541.</p>

                    <h3>Visit the Argentina side of Iguazu Falls</h3>
                    <p>An expansive network of walkways take visitors above and across the upper and lower levels of the
                        falls. The Argentina side allows visitors to get very close to the falls (above and under the
                        falls). The waves of mist from the falls are absolutely refreshing in the tropical heat!

                    <h3>Visit the Brazil side of Iguaçu Falls</h3>
                    <p>The Brazil side let’s you get very close to the foot of the falls and provides visitors with a
                        panoramic view of the Argentina side, with its multiple cascades. There are many paths that wind
                        along the canyon and the jungle with various viewing platforms along the way. The highlight is
                        the platform and series of walkways at the foot of one of the upper waterfalls.
