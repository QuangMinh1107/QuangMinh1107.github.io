                <h2>Hallstatt - Small village with a great history</h2>
                <p>The picturesque village on the lake with the same name owes its existence to the rich salt deposit of
                    salt in the mountain of Hallstatt. 7000 years ago, as the prehistoric humans from Hallstatt began to
                    take the salt from the salt mine who would of guessed, that this little village would give its name
                    to a period in history â€“ the Hallstatt period (800-400 BC). Rich findings in Hallstatt and the upper
                    valley of Hallstatt gave this village international recognition; even today discoveries are still
                    made in the salt mountain of Hallstatt. Among the most beautiful places of interest are the oldest
                    salt mine in the world and the ossuary in Hallstatt, a romantic boat ride on Lake Hallstatt, a trip
                    to the breathtaking cave world in Obertraun and a visit to the Lake Gosau with the mighty Dachstein
                    glacier. Additionally, Bad Goisern is popular in the summer with hikers and bikers. In winter guests
                    are lured in by the ski areas of Dachstein West in Gosau and the Ski and Freeride Arena in
                    neighboring Obertraun with perfect slope conditions. We wish you an unforgettable holiday in
                    Hallstatt!</p>
